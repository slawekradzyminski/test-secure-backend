üîß Implementation Plan for ‚Äúthink‚Äù Flag Support (Ollama integration)
Goal ‚Äì add an optional think boolean (default false) to the request DTOs that back the /api/ollama/chat and /api/ollama/generate endpoints, wire it through to Ollama, and keep the whole test-suite and docs green.

1 Extend the DTOs
(Java source in src/main/java/com/awesome/testing/dto/ollama)

File	Action
ChatRequestDto.java	‚Ä¢ Add field
@Schema(description="Should the model think before responding?",example="false")
@Builder.Default private Boolean think = false;
StreamedRequestDto.java	Same addition as above
GenerateRequestDto.java	Same addition as above

Keep annotations identical to existing stream and keepAlive fields so they stay hidden from Swagger when defaulted.
Lombok‚Äôs @Builder.Default keeps existing builders/tests compiling without code changes

COMMIT POINT: DTOs added ‚Äì compile succeeds, no behavioural change yet.

2 Propagate the flag to OllamaService
File	Action
OllamaService#getStreamingRequest	Pass think when constructing GenerateRequestDto ‚Äì adjust constructor / builder accordingly 
OllamaService#chat	Nothing to do ‚Äì the full ChatRequestDto (now with think) is already body-posted.

COMMIT POINT: service layer updated ‚Äì unit tests still pass.

3 Update WireMock stubs & factories
Tests live below src/test/java/com/awesome/testing

Factories (OllamaRequestFactory):

Builders automatically expose the new property ‚Äì no change needed unless we want explicit think(true) test cases.

WireMock expectations (OllamaChatControllerTest, OllamaGenerateControllerTest):

Add one happy-path test each where the request‚Äôs think is true, and extend verify(‚Ä¶matchingJsonPath("$.think", equalTo("true"))).

Utility stub class OllamaMock:

No body-matching change required; existing stubs return streaming chunks and ignore body.

Optional: loosen any .withRequestBody(matchingJsonPath(...)) in future-proof helper methods.

COMMIT POINT: all tests compile; new red tests remind us to finish wiring.

4 End-to-end functional tests
Service-level test (OllamaServiceTest): mock WebClient and assert that the generated body contains think=true.

Controller smoke: the two new controller tests from Step 3 should now be green.

COMMIT POINT: full Maven test suite green.

5 Documentation & API surface
Swagger/OpenAPI ‚Äì field‚Äêlevel @Schema annotations added already expose the flag.

README ‚Äì in ‚ÄúOllama Endpoints‚Äù sections, add bullet:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
"think": false // optional ‚Äì set true for 'thinking' models
Changelog ‚Äì note backward-compatible addition.

COMMIT POINT: docs updated.

6 Regression & CI
Run mvn test && ./test-ollama-endpoint.sh to hit a running Ollama (if available).

Docker pipeline (Jenkinsfile) unchanged ‚Äì just ensure new tests pass in CI.

Merge PR ‚Üí squash & merge, delete branch.

üß™ Test Matrix (incremental)
Layer	Scenario	Expected
Unit OllamaServiceTest	think=false (default)	Body omits flag (backwards-compat)
Unit OllamaServiceTest	think=true	Body contains "think":true
Controller IT ‚Äì /chat	Happy path with think=true	200 SSE, WireMock sees flag
Controller IT ‚Äì /generate	Same as above	200 SSE, WireMock sees flag
Validation	Missing model / prompt	unchanged 400 responses
Security	Un-auth request still 401	

7 Potential pitfalls & mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Jackson default suppression drops think:false in JSON	This is desired for wire-compat; only send when true.
Constructor signature drift after Lombok change	Rely on builders; avoid direct ctor calls.
Ollama server older than flag	Default remains false, so payload identical to today.

üéâ Implementation complete ‚Äì ready for PR review.
