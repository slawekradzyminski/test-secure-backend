Quickstart
The code of Qwen3 has been in the latest Hugging Face transformers and we advise you to use the latest version of transformers.

With transformers<4.51.0, you will encounter the following error:

KeyError: 'qwen3'

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs.

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"

# load the tokenizer and the model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
model_name,
torch_dtype="auto",
device_map="auto"
)

# prepare the model input
prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."
messages = [
{"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
messages,
tokenize=False,
add_generation_prompt=True,
enable_thinking=True # Switches between thinking and non-thinking modes. Default is True.
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

# conduct text completion
generated_ids = model.generate(
**model_inputs,
max_new_tokens=32768
)
output_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()

# parsing thinking content
try:
# rindex finding 151668 (</think>)
index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)
except ValueError:
index = 0

thinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")
content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")

print("thinking content:", thinking_content)
print("content:", content)

For deployment, you can use sglang>=0.4.6.post1 or vllm>=0.8.5 or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:

SGLang:
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --reasoning-parser qwen3

vLLM:
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1

For local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.

Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode
The enable_thinking switch is also available in APIs created by SGLang and vLLM. Please refer to our documentation for SGLang and vLLM users.

enable_thinking=True
By default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting enable_thinking=True or leaving it as the default value in tokenizer.apply_chat_template, the model will engage its thinking mode.

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
messages,
tokenize=False,
add_generation_prompt=True,
enable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking
)

In this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a <think>...</think> block, followed by the final response.

For thinking mode, use Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, and MinP=0 (the default setting in generation_config.json). DO NOT use greedy decoding, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the Best Practices section.

enable_thinking=False
We provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model's thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
messages,
tokenize=False,
add_generation_prompt=True,
enable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode
)

In this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a <think>...</think> block.

For non-thinking mode, we suggest using Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, and MinP=0. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the Best Practices section.

Advanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input
We provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model's behavior when enable_thinking=True. Specifically, you can add /think and /no_think to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.

Here is an example of a multi-turn conversation:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

class QwenChatbot:
def __init__(self, model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"):
self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
self.history = []

    def generate_response(self, user_input):
        messages = self.history + [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]

        text = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
            messages,
            tokenize=False,
            add_generation_prompt=True
        )

        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
        response_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()
        response = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)

        # Update history
        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})

        return response

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
chatbot = QwenChatbot()

    # First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)
    user_input_1 = "How many r's in strawberries?"
    print(f"User: {user_input_1}")
    response_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)
    print(f"Bot: {response_1}")
    print("----------------------")

    # Second input with /no_think
    user_input_2 = "Then, how many r's in blueberries? /no_think"
    print(f"User: {user_input_2}")
    response_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)
    print(f"Bot: {response_2}") 
    print("----------------------")

    # Third input with /think
    user_input_3 = "Really? /think"
    print(f"User: {user_input_3}")
    response_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)
    print(f"Bot: {response_3}")

For API compatibility, when enable_thinking=True, regardless of whether the user uses /think or /no_think, the model will always output a block wrapped in <think>...</think>. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled. When enable_thinking=False, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any /think or /no_think tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a <think>...</think> block.

Agentic Use
Qwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using Qwen-Agent to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.

To define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.

from qwen_agent.agents import Assistant

# Define LLM
llm_cfg = {
'model': 'Qwen3-0.6B',

    # Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:
    # 'model_type': 'qwen_dashscope',
    # 'api_key': os.getenv('DASHSCOPE_API_KEY'),

    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:
    'model_server': 'http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base
    'api_key': 'EMPTY',

    # Other parameters:
    # 'generate_cfg': {
    #         # Add: When the response content is `<think>this is the thought</think>this is the answer;
    #         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.
    #         'thought_in_content': True,
    #     },
}

# Define Tools
tools = [
{'mcpServers': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file
'time': {
'command': 'uvx',
'args': ['mcp-server-time', '--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai']
},
"fetch": {
"command": "uvx",
"args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
}
}
},
'code_interpreter',  # Built-in tools
]

# Define Agent
bot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)

# Streaming generation
messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen'}]
for responses in bot.run(messages=messages):
pass
print(responses)

Best Practices
To achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:

Sampling Parameters:

For thinking mode (enable_thinking=True), use Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, and MinP=0. DO NOT use greedy decoding, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.
For non-thinking mode (enable_thinking=False), we suggest using Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, and MinP=0.
For supported frameworks, you can adjust the presence_penalty parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.
Adequate Output Length: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.

Standardize Output Format: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.

Math Problems: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.
Multiple-Choice Questions: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the answer field with only the choice letter, e.g., "answer": "C"."
No Thinking Content in History: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.
